# The Battleship Breaker

This repo contains a Tampermonkey UserScript that breaks the battleship game.

The script tries to replace the original script that controls the game function with a custom one that makes battleships visible no matter what. The injection may fail depending on how the browser treats it. The user may also override the original script manually and permanently using browser debugging tools.
